# SimpleEVSE-WiFi

SimpleEVSE-WiFi brings WiFi functionality to your SimpleEVSE WB to control your Charging Station very easy. It uses an ESP8266 to communicate with SimpleEVSE WB via ModBus (UART) and offers a web interface to control it. Optional there is a possibility to connect an impulse meter via S0 and an RC522 RFID reader to detect valid RFID tags.

If you want to support this project, I would be very happy about a donation.

## What You Will Need

### Hardware
* A complete Wallbox based on EVSE Wallbox [link](http://evracing.cz/simple-evse-wallbox/) (min. Software revision 8 (2017-10-31) is needed - read the manual there for updating your EVSE software)
**Attention: revision 9 does not work, because there is a bug in the firmware.**
* An ESP8266 module or a development board like **WeMos D1 mini** or **NodeMcu 1.0**
* (optional) An electricity meter with S0 interface
* (optional) A MFRC522 RFID Module (PN532 and Wiegand based RFID reader modules are not supported at this time)
* (optional) n quantity of Mifare Classic 1KB (recommended due to available code base) PICCs (RFID Tags) equivalent to User Number

#### Wiring (WeMos D1 mini/ NodeMcu)
SimpleEVSE-WiFi supports not only the control of the EVSE WB but also the use of a simple button or an RC522 RFID card reader to activate the charging process. With an optional electricity meter, the power requirements of the individual charging processes can be output.

##### Mandatory
This wiring is mandatory and absolutely needed to run SimpleEVSE-WiFi

ESP8266-Pin | ESP8266-GPIO | EVSE WB
----------- | ----------- | -----------
D1 | GPIO5 | TX
D2 | GPIO4 | RX
GND |  | GND

##### Button (optional)
ESP8266-Pin | ESP8266-GPIO | Button
----------- | ----------- | -----------
D4 | GPIO2 | Pin 1
GND | | Pin 2

##### S0 Electicity Meter (optional)*
ESP8266-Pin | ESP8266-GPIO | electricity meter
----------- | ----------- | -----------
D3 | GPIO0 | S0+
GND | | S0-

##### Modbus Electicity Meter (optional - experimental!)**
TTL->RS485 | ESP8266-Pin
----------- | -----------
RX | RX 
TX | TX 
VCC | 5V
GND | GND

TTL->RS485 | Modbus Meter 
----------- | -----------
A+ | A
B- | B



##### RC522 RFID-Reader (optional)
ESP8266-Pin | ESP8266-GPIO | RC522
----------- | ----------- | -----------
D5 | GPIO14 | SCK
D6 | GPIO12 | MISO
D7 | GPIO13 | MOSI
D8 | GPIO15 | SDA
GND |  | GND
3.3V |  | 3.3V

Be sure to use a suitable power supply for ESP. At least 500mA is recommended!

\*When you use an electricity meter with S0 interface be sure the S0 interface switches to GND, don't use 3.3V or 5V!

\*\*To use a Modbus electricity meter via RS485, you need a extra piece of hardware to translate UART to RS485. In this project a PCB like [this](https://www.amazon.de/WINGONEER-RS485-Adapter-Serieller-Converter/dp/B06XHH6B6R/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1530052971&sr=8-1&keywords=rs485+uart) is required. Set your meter to baud rate 9600 and slave ID to "002". Until now only SDM120 and SDM630 Modbus meters are supported! If you have another one you can use it with the S0 interface.

#### Preparation of EVSE Wallbox
To use SimpleEVSE-WiFi, the Modbus functionallity of EVSE Wallbox is needed! By default, Modbus functionality is disabled. To activate it, pull AN input of the EVSE Wallbox board to GND while booting for at least 5 times within 3 seconds. Modbus register 2001 will be set to 1 (Modbus is active). Attention: That change will not be saved! To save the settings, you have to give a R/W operation at a register >=2000. The easiest way to do this is to activate and deactivate EVSE through the WebUI in the "EVSE Control" page.

### Software

**Attention:** make sure that the EVSE WB is not connected to the ESP during the flash process via USB. It could cause overheating of the ESP.

#### Use Compiled Binaries
Compiled firmware binary and flasher tool for Windows PCs are available in directory **/bin**. On Windows you can use **"flash.bat"**, it will ask you which COM port that ESP is connected and then flashes it. You can use any flashing tool and do the flashing manually if you don't want to use the flash.bat.

You also need to upload web files to your ESP with ESP8266FS Uploader.

* [ESP8266FS Uploader](https://github.com/esp8266/arduino-esp8266fs-plugin) - Arduino ESP8266 filesystem uploader

Unlisted libraries are part of [ESP8266](https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino) Core for Arduino IDE, so you don't need to download them, but check that at least you have v2.4.0 or above installed.

## First boot
When SimpleEVSE-WiFi starts for the first time it sets up a WiFi access point called 'evse-wifi'. You can connect without a password. To connect, open http://192.168.4.1 in your browser. The initial password is 'adminadmin'. You should first check the Settings to bring the ESP in Client mode and connect it to your local WiFi network. The ESP will be restarted afterwards. If it doesn't restart, press the 'RST' button once. Sometimes the ESP must first be manually reset (this only has to happen after flashing a new firmware).

## Support this Project
The development of SimpleEVSE-WiFi is very time consuming. If you want to support this project, I would be very happy about a [donation](https://www.paypal.com/pools/c/85c7xRbeay).

## HTTP API

  }]
}
```

### setCurrent()
using setCurrent() will set the current to the given value (e.g. 18A)

Parameter | Description
--------- | -----------
current | Current to set in EVSE WiFi

#### Example

`GET http://192.168.4.1/setCurrent?current=8`

> Sets the charging current  to 8A and returns

```text
S0_set current to 8A
```
In cases of Error, the answer would be

Answer | Description
--------- | -----------
E0_could not set current - internal error | Internal error occured (unspecified)
E1_could not set current - give a value between *x* and *y*  | Wrong value was given
E2_could not set current - wrong parameter | Wrong parameter was given

### setStatus()
will activate/deactivate EVSE WB

```
In cases of Error, the answer would be

Answer | Description
--------- | -----------
E0_could not activate EVSE - internal error | Internal error occured (unspecified)
E0_could not deactivate EVSE - internal error | Internal error occured (unspecified)
E1_could not process - give a valid value (true/false) | Wrong value was given
E2_could not process - wrong parameter | Wrong parameter was given
E3_could not activate EVSE - EVSE already activated! | EVSE is already in state "active"
