ðŸ’¾ [Latest Downloads, News and Changelogs (german)](https://www.evse-wifi.de/)

## Attention:
This file describes the structure of EVSE-WiFi in version 1.x.x and is only valid for the ESP8266. For the use of EVSE-WiFi 2.0 (based on ESP32) it is recommended to use the dedicated hardware 'EVSE-WiFi 2.0 Base'. You can find further information on www.evse-wifi.de. The EVSE-WiFi 2.0 Base Module can be bought [here](https://www.evse-wifi.de/produkt/evse-wifi-2-0-base/).

## Introduction

EVSE-WiFi brings WiFi functionality to your EVSE WB/DIN to control your Charging Station very easy. It uses an ESP8266 to communicate with the EVSE WB charging controller via ModBus (UART) and offers a web interface to control nearly everything. Optional there is a possibility to connect an impulse meter via S0 or a Modbus meter (RS485-TTL Adapter is required) and an RFID reader to detect valid RFID tags.

If you want to support this project, I would be very happy about a donation.

## What You Will Need

### Attention:
This file describes the structure of EVSE-WiFi in version 1.x.x and is only valid for the ESP8266. For the use of EVSE-WiFi 2.0 (based on ESP32) it is recommended to use the dedicated hardware 'EVSE-WiFi 2.0 Base'. You can find further information on www.evse-wifi.de. The EVSE-WiFi 2.0 Base Module can be bought [here](https://www.evse-wifi.de/produkt/evse-wifi-2-0-base/).

### Hardware
* A complete Wallbox based on [EVSE Wallbox](https://www.evse-wifi.de/produkt/evse-wallbox-steuereinheit/) or [EVSE DIN](https://www.evse-wifi.de/produkt/evse-din-ladecontroller/) (min. Software revision 8 (2017-10-31) is needed - read the manual there for updating your EVSE software)
**Attention: revision 9 does not work, because there is a bug in the firmware (sold for a short time in 2018)**
* An ESP8266 module or a development board like **WeMos D1 mini** or **NodeMcu 1.0**
* (optional) An electricity meter with S0 or RS485/Modbus interface. (At this time only SDM120 and SDM630 are supported for use with Modbus)
* (optional) A [RFID Module](https://www.evse-wifi.de/produkt/evse-wifi-rfid-reader-modul/) (PN532 and Wiegand based RFID reader modules are not supported at this time)
* (optional) n quantity of [Mifare Classic 1KB](https://www.evse-wifi.de/produkt/evse-wifi-rfid-karte/) (recommended due to available code base) PICCs (RFID Tags) equivalent to User Number

#### Wiring (WeMos D1 mini/ NodeMcu)
SimpleEVSE-WiFi supports not only the control of the EVSE WB but also the use of a simple button or an RC522 RFID card reader to activate the charging process. With an optional electricity meter, the power requirements of the individual charging processes can be output.

##### Mandatory
This wiring is mandatory and absolutely needed to run SimpleEVSE-WiFi

ESP8266-Pin | ESP8266-GPIO | EVSE WB

D1 | GPIO5 | TX
D2 | GPIO4 | RX
GND |  | GND

##### Button (optional)

----------- | -----------
RX | RX 
TX | TX 
VCC | 5V
GND | GND

TTL->RS485 | Modbus Meter 
----------- | -----------

B- | B



##### RC522 RFID-Reader (optional)
ESP8266-Pin | ESP8266-GPIO | RC522
----------- | ----------- | -----------
D5 | GPIO14 | SCK
D6 | GPIO12 | MISO
D7 | GPIO13 | MOSI
D8 | GPIO15 | SDA
GND |  | GND
3.3V |  | 3.3V

Be sure to use a suitable power supply for ESP. At least 500mA is recommended!

\*When you use an electricity meter with S0 interface be sure the S0 interface switches to GND, don't use 3.3V or 5V!

\*\*To use a Modbus electricity meter via RS485, you need a extra piece of hardware to translate UART to RS485. In this project a PCB like [this](https://www.evse-wifi.de/produkt/evse-wifi-ttl-rs485-converter/) is required. Set your meter to baud rate 9600 and slave ID to "002". Until now only SDM120 and SDM630 Modbus meters are supported! If you have another one you can use it with the S0 interface.

#### Preparation of EVSE Wallbox
To use EVSE-WiFi, the modbus functionallity of EVSE WB/DIN is needed! By default, modbus functionality is disabled. To activate it, pull AN input of the EVSE board to GND while booting for at least 5 times within 3 seconds. Modbus register 2001 will be set to 1 (Modbus is active). Attention: That change will not be saved! To save the settings, you have to give a R/W operation at a register >=2000. The easiest way to do this is to activate and deactivate EVSE through the WebUI in the "EVSE Control" page.

### Software

#### Attention:
This file describes the structure of EVSE-WiFi in version 1.x.x and is only valid for the ESP8266. For the use of EVSE-WiFi 2.0 (based on ESP32) it is recommended to use the dedicated hardware 'EVSE-WiFi 2.0 Base'. You can find further information on www.evse-wifi.de. The EVSE-WiFi 2.0 Base Module can be bought [here](https://www.evse-wifi.de/produkt/evse-wifi-2-0-base/).

**Attention:** make sure that the EVSE WB/DIN is not connected to the ESP during the flash process via USB. It could cause overheating of the ESP.

#### Use Compiled Binaries
Compiled firmware binary and flasher tool for Windows PCs are available in on www.evse-wifi.de. On Windows you can use **"flash.bat"**, it will ask you which COM port that ESP is connected and then flashes it. You can use any flashing tool and do the flashing manually if you don't want to use the flash.bat.

Unlisted libraries are part of [ESP8266](https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino) Core for Arduino IDE, so you don't need to download them, but check that at least you have v2.4.0 or above installed.

## First boot
When SimpleEVSE-WiFi starts for the first time it sets up a WiFi access point called 'evse-wifi'. You can connect without a password. To connect, open http://192.168.4.1 in your browser. The initial password is 'adminadmin'. You should first check the Settings to bring the ESP in Client mode and connect it to your local WiFi network. The ESP will be restarted afterwards. If it doesn't restart, press the 'RST' button once. Sometimes the ESP must first be manually reset (this only has to happen after flashing a new firmware).

## Support this Project
The development of SimpleEVSE-WiFi is very time consuming. If you want to support this project, I would be very happy about a [donation](https://www.paypal.com/pools/c/85c7xRbeay).
