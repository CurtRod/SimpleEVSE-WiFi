# SimpleEVSE-WiFi

SimpleEVSE-WiFi brings WiFi functionality to your SimpleEVSE WB to control your Charging Station very easy. It uses an ESP8266 to communicate with SimpleEVSE WB via ModBus (UART) and offers a web interface to control it. Optional there is a possibility to connect an impulse meter via S0 and an RC522 RFID reader to detect valid RFID tags.

## Main Features

* WiFi functionality (as an access point or as a WiFi client)
* Activate and deactivate the Simple EVSE WB via a web interface, RFID tags or a button
* Setting the charging current via the web interface
* Displays the current charging power in kW (by impulses of the S0 counter, optional)
* User management (RFID tags, optional)
* Log of the last charging processes with output of the charged energy quantity, charging time and costs of the charging process (optionally which RFID tag the EVSE was enabled by and the user assigned to it)
* Rudimentary settings (WiFi settings, password for web interface, maximum charging current, etc.)
* Output of all important parameters of the SimpleEVSE WB (Modbus)

## Preview

## What You Will Need

### Hardware
* A complete Wallbox based on EVSE Wallbox [link](http://evracing.cz/simple-evse-wallbox/) (min. Software revision 8 is needed - read the manual there for updating your EVSE software)
* An ESP8266 module or a development board like **WeMos D1 mini** or **NodeMcu 1.0**
* (optional) An electricity meter with S0 interface
* (optional) A MFRC522 RFID Module (PN532 and Wiegand based RFID reader modules are not supported at this time)
* (optional) n quantity of Mifare Classic 1KB (recommended due to available code base) PICCs (RFID Tags) equivalent to User Number

#### Wiring (WeMos D1 mini/ NodeMcu)

* D0	 ->	Button (optional)
* D1	 ->	TX EVSE
* D2	 ->	RX EVSE
* D3	 ->	Electricity Meter S0 (optional)*
* D5	 ->	SCK RC522 (optional)
* D6	 ->	MISO RC522 (optional)
* D7	 ->	MOSI RC522 (optional)
* D8	 ->	SDA RC522 (optional)
* GND  ->	Electricity Meter S0 (optional)*
* GND  ->	GND RC522 (optional)
* 3.3V ->	3.3V RC522 (optinal)

Be sure to use a suitable power supply for ESP. At least 200mA is recommended!

*When you use an electricity meter be sure the S0 interface switches to GND, don't use 3.3V or 5V!

#### Preparation of EVSE Wallbox
To use SimpleEVSE-WiFi, the Modbus functionallity of EVSE Wallbox is needed! By default, Modbus functionality is disabled. To activate it, pull AN input of the EVSE Wallbox board to GND while booting for at least 5 times within 3 seconds. Modbus register 2001 will be set to 1 (Modbus is active). Attention: That change will not be saved! To save the settings, you have to give a R/W operation at a register >=2000. The easiest way to do this is to activate and deactivate EVSE through the WebUI in the "EVSE Control" page.

### Software

**Attention:** make sure that the EVSE WB is not connected to the ESP during the flash process via USB. It could cause overheating of the ESP.

#### Use Compiled Binaries
Compiled firmware binary and flasher tool for Windows PCs are available in directory **/bin**. On Windows you can use **"flash.bat"**, it will ask you which COM port that ESP is connected and then flashes it. You can use any flashing tool and do the flashing manually if you don't want to use the flash.bat.

#### Building From Source
Please install Arduino IDE if you didn't already, then add ESP8266 Core on top of it. Additional Library download links are listed below:

Unlisted libraries are part of ESP8266 Core for Arduino IDE, so you don't need to download them.

## First boot
When SimpleEVSE-WiFi starts for the first time it sets up a WiFi access point called 'evse-wifi'. You can connect without a password. To connect, open http://192.168.4.1 in your browser. The initial password is 'admin'. You should first check the Settings to bring the ESP in Client mode and connect it to your local WiFi network. The ESP will be restarted afterwards. If it doesn't restart, press the 'RST' button once. Sometimes the ESP must first be manually reset (this only has to happen after flashing a new firmware).

## HTTP API
Since version 0.2.0 there is an HTTP API implemented to let other devices control your EVSE WiFi. The API gives you the following possibilities of setting and fetching information.

### getParameters()
gives you the following information of the EVSE WB in json:

actualPower | actual power consumption (when S0 meter is used)
duration | charging duration in milliseconds
energy | charged energy of the current charging process in kWh

#### Example
`GET http://192.168.4.1/getParameters`

> returns JSON like this:

```json

    "duration": 1152251,
    "energy": "2.17",
    "price": 23
  }]
}
```

### setCurrent()
using setCurrent() will set the current to the given value (e.g. 18A)

Parameter | Description
--------- | -----------
current | Current to set in EVSE WiFi

#### Example

`GET http://192.168.4.1/setCurrent?current=8`

> Sets the charging current  to 8A and returns

```
In cases of Error, the answer would be
